** Short term (tomorrow morning)

- Wade through SDSocialNetworkTask.m and add/fix error handling where necessary
- Fix the multipart/form data section of said file, to allow for image uploading
- Add the ivars necessary for half of the task types
- Comment things better, and write some good sample tests for devs to get started with
- Write the README (instead of just stealing Matt Gemmell's)
	- Write instructions in the README
	- Merge this file into the README
	- Figure out a good way to explain the license, similarly to how Matt did
- See if any names need standardizing

** Long term (this weekend)

- Add support for other services:
	- identi.ca
	- Facebook
	- yammer
	- friendfeed
