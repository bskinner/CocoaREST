## Short term (tomorrow morning)

- Wade through SDSocialNetworkTask.m and add/fix error handling where necessary
- Fix the multipart/form data section of said file, to allow for image uploading
- Add the ivars necessary for half of the task types
- Comment things better, and write some good sample tests for devs to get started with
- See if any names need standardizing
- Either make this twitter-only, or generalize the Task class to be subclassable for different subclasses per service. Flip a coin to determine. A USA Quarter coin is preferred, though any other USA coin will suit, as long as its two sides are easily distinguishable and it does not have excessive amounts of rust on it.

## Long term (this weekend)

- Add support for other services:
	- identi.ca
	- Facebook
	- yammer
	- friendfeed
