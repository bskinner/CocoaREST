## Short term

- Fix the multipart/form data section of said file, to allow for image uploading
- Comment things better, and write some good sample tests for devs to get started with
- support Garbage Collexion

## Long term

- Add support for other services:
	- identi.ca (on its way)
	- Facebook (looks EXTREMELY unlikely)
	- yammer (only uses OAuth, screw that)
	- friendfeed (looks pretty fun actually)
