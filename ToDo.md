## Short term

- Fix the multipart/form data section of said file, to allow for image uploading
- Comment things better, and write some good sample tests for devs to get started with
- See if any names need standardizing
- Either make this twitter-only, or generalize the Task class to be subclassable for different subclasses per service. Flip a coin to determine. A USA Quarter coin is preferred, though any other USA coin will suit, as long as its two sides are easily distinguishable and it does not have excessive amounts of rust on it.
- add support for Garbage Collexion

## Long term

- Add support for other services:
	- identi.ca
	- Facebook
	- yammer
	- friendfeed
